# Optimistic2Argent
Optimistic Ethereum is an EVM-compatible Optimistic Rollup chain. It aims to be fast, simple, and secure. This is a short research for eligible Argent wallets for the upcoming Optimism airdrop.

**Background:**
"The Optimism Foundation’s Airdrop #1 rewards those who have been instrumental as early adopters and active users of projects in the Optimism ecosystem. To celebrate our Ethereum roots, we also want to welcome active L1 participants who can help scale Ethereum’s innovations, culture, and values to Layer 2. In total, 248,699 addresses are eligible to claim OP in this initial airdrop." More can be found [here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/)

The Argent wallet is a smart wallet on Ethereum and is also availble on L2 like Zksync. More info can be found [here](https://www.argent.xyz). The Argent smart wallet contracts are included in the snapshot for the upcoming Optimism airdrop. 

**The problem** however is that the Argent smart contract wallets are not deployed on L2 chains and therefor they could not claim the $OP airdrop on the Optimistic L2 chain.

How much Argent smart wallet users will miss the upcoming $OP airdrop. First is to line up how much Argent users they are:
There are 5 distinct Argent contracts that are used to create the user's smart wallet contracts on Ethereum.
